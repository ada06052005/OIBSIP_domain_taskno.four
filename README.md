# Project Summary: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression üè°
This project demonstrates the application of Linear Regression to predict house prices based on various features. The goal was to build a robust predictive model and evaluate its performance using key metrics.

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning üìä
The initial step involved understanding and preparing the dataset:

Loading Data: The housing dataset was loaded, and its first few rows were inspected to understand the features.

Data Structure: df.info() was used to get a concise summary, confirming the number of entries and columns, and checking data types.

Missing Values: A thorough check for missing values (df.isnull().sum()) revealed that the dataset was remarkably clean, with no missing entries across any of the columns.

2. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering üõ†Ô∏è
To make the data suitable for the linear regression model, several preprocessing steps were performed:

Categorical Feature Identification: Columns containing non-numerical (object) data were identified as categorical features (e.g., mainroad, guestroom, furnishingstatus).

One-Hot Encoding: These categorical columns were converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding (pd.get_dummies). This process creates new binary columns for each category, which is essential for linear regression models. drop_first=True was used to avoid multicollinearity.

Feature-Target Split: The dataset was divided into features (X), which are the independent variables used for prediction, and the target variable (y), which is the house price.

Train-Test Split: The data was further split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. This ensures that the model is trained on one subset of the data and evaluated on unseen data, providing a realistic assessment of its predictive power.

3. Model Training ü§ñ
A Linear Regression model was initialized and trained using the prepared training data:

The model learned the relationships between the various house features (e.g., area, bedrooms, bathrooms, one-hot encoded categorical features) and their corresponding prices.

4. Model Evaluation üìà
The trained model's performance was rigorously evaluated on the test set:

Predictions: The model made predictions (y_pred) on the unseen test data.

Metrics: The following metrics were calculated to assess the model's accuracy:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. A low MAE indicates higher accuracy.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Calculates the average of the squares of the errors. It gives higher weight to larger errors.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the target variable (price).

R-squared (R¬≤): Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. An R¬≤ of 0.65 means that 65% of the variance in house prices can be explained by the model's features.

5. Visualization üìä
A regression plot was generated to visually compare the actual house prices against the prices predicted by the model. - This plot helps to understand how well the model's predictions align with the true values, indicating the model's overall fit and areas where it might deviate.

# Tools Used üß∞
This project utilized the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data loading, exploration, and manipulation (e.g., read_csv, head, info, isnull().sum(), drop, get_dummies).

NumPy: For numerical operations, particularly for calculating the square root of MSE (np.sqrt).

Scikit-learn (sklearn):

model_selection.train_test_split: For splitting data into training and testing sets.

linear_model.LinearRegression: For implementing the linear regression model.

metrics: For calculating evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤.

Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn: For data visualization, specifically to create the regression plot.
